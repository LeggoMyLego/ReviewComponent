Like many of my reviews i dont like to bore anyone with many details they might already know...Just know that if you are a Darth Vader fan(Like me) or a Lego Star wars fan then get this set...you will not regret it...it was a fun build and its a great display set for adults and a great play sets with kids..minifigures are great too, no krennic but its still a great group of figs...you can always add a Director Krennic minifigure to the mix anyway since hes not a difficult figure to get ;)... All in all an amazing set... Vader definitely has the high ground now! haha.',2,1,100,5,5),(326,4,'2020-01-01',_binary '','A+ for this A-Wing.3','I’m an AFOL who has been a fan of LEGO for a very long time, especially LEGO Star Wars.
